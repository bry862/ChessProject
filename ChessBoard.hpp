         *          - Pieces on the UPPER half of the board are set to be NOT "moving up"| of color "WHITE"
         *          - Their row & col members reflect their position on the board
         *          - All other parameters are default initialized.
         *   
         *      - Pawns (P), Rooks(R), Bishops(B), Kings(K), Queens(Q), and Knights(N) are placed in the following format (ie. the standard setup for chess):
         *          
         *          7 | R N B K Q B N R
         *          6 | P P P P P P P P
